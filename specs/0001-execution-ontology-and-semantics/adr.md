# ADR-0001: Execution ontology and composition semantics

## Status

Proposed. Shared semantic edition: execution-semantics-1. Requirements are
targets; runtime conformance is unevidenced by this record. Authoring or
replicating this proposal does not accept it, change a published contract, or
authorize a release. Existing implementation experiments require review against
these semantics before their APIs are finalized.

## Context

### Background and Problem Statement

Cancellation and timing APIs participate in sequential, concurrent, racing, and
shared-work compositions. A tree-shaped parent/child explanation describes some
links but does not describe the whole execution model. A shorter API can silently
lose necessary behavior if it collapses cancellation forwarding, result
selection, and completion into ordinary promise settlement.

This record contains its own definitions, normative clauses, policy vocabulary,
and planned cases. No other specification is required to interpret it. Shared
semantic text is replicated into participating repositories rather than imported
through cross-specification references. Repository-specific adoption is stated
separately below the shared text.

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

- Preserve useful asynchronous composition without accidental ownership transfer.
- Make cancellation, waiting, work settlement, and cleanup distinguishable.
- Keep specialized providers authoritative for their own invariants.

### Secondary Decision Drivers

- Prefer ordinary native-async interfaces without requiring a universal runtime.
- Make semantic copies independently readable and their drift reviewable.
- State conditional laws and executable counterexamples rather than global claims.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Describe every relationship as parent and child

**Advantages:** Simple explanation for nested cancellation links.

**Disadvantages:** Conflates shared work, ownership, result dependencies, and
cancellation direction; cannot explain many-to-one relationships precisely.

**Risk Assessment:** High risk of premature cleanup and unintended propagation.

### Option 2: Require one task graph runtime for every provider

**Advantages:** One engine could track the executions it creates.

**Disadvantages:** Imposes a carrier and interpreter; cannot retroactively own
opaque promises or detached effects; displaces specialized provider invariants.

**Risk Assessment:** Excessive coupling and unsupported completion claims.

### Option 3: Share explicit semantics while retaining provider-owned engines

**Advantages:** Supports native async interfaces, explicit policy, independent
providers, and precise ownership boundaries.

**Disadvantages:** Requires deliberate policies, migration witnesses, and review
of replicated semantic editions.

**Risk Assessment:** Bounded if completion and authority remain explicit.

## Decision

Propose option 3. The following shared semantic section is complete in this
record. Its edition identifies meaning, not an npm version, runtime protocol
object, or universal conformance certificate.

<!-- shared-execution-semantics: execution-semantics-1 begin -->

### Semantic scope and vocabulary

The words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT express normative obligations.
Every requirement in this shared section has requirement status target and
evidence status unevidenced until repository-local evidence is reviewed. These
definitions specify behavior, not mandatory classes, fields, or runtime objects.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Capability | An available operation or facility, with its provider's validity and authority conditions. |
| Requirement | A structural description of capabilities an operation needs. |
| Operation | A deferred context-dependent computation; construction alone does not invoke it. |
| Execution | One invocation of an operation, including the work it represents; not necessarily a separately scheduled task. |
| Operator | A reusable transformation of operations, possibly changing input requirements or selected results. |
| Context | Explicit execution input containing capabilities and data; references alone establish neither ownership nor admission. |
| Context derivation | Explicit inheritance, replacement, narrowing, or intentional omission of execution input. |
| Scope | A boundary retaining its declared obligations through represented work and mandatory cleanup. |
| Owner | The participant responsible for a declared resource's release or an execution's completion obligations. |
| Borrower | A participant allowed to use a facility without thereby acquiring release or cancellation authority. |
| Cancellation source | State together with authority to request cancellation of its designated execution or group. |
| Cancellation signal | Observation of a cancellation request and its reason, not authority to cancel the source. |
| Cancellation link | An explicitly selected directed propagation rule between cancellation sources/signals. |
| Upstream / downstream | Direction relative to a named propagation link, not a universal ancestry relation. |
| Waiter | An observer of a result whose waiting lifetime may end independently of the underlying execution. |
| Result settlement | Availability of the fulfillment or rejection selected for a particular result observer. |
| Work settlement | Fulfillment or rejection of the underlying work represented at the named boundary. |
| Actual completion | Work settlement plus completion of all mandatory cleanup and owned-completion obligations at that boundary. |
| Admission | Provider-validated permission to enter an operation on a lifecycle participant. |
| Completion lease | Provider-owned accounting that retains protection for admitted represented work until its required completion boundary. |
| Deadline constraint | An absolute bound in an identified clock domain, distinct from a scheduler or owned timer. |
| Supervision | Explicit authority and policy for starting, observing, requesting cancellation of, and retaining completion of designated executions. |

Parent and child MAY describe a specifically named nesting or propagation
relationship. They MUST NOT stand alone as names for result dependencies,
ownership, admission, or every execution relationship. In cancellation prose,
prefer owned cancellation source, borrowed upstream signal, and directed link.
Multiple downstream signals may observe one upstream signal; one source may
combine several upstream requests. Neither relationship implies task spawning.

### Independent relationships and observable events

Each composition distinguishes these relationships even when one implementation
uses the same objects to represent several of them:

- Result dependencies: which outcomes determine a selected result.
- Cancellation propagation: which requests reach which designated executions.
- Ownership and borrowing: who may cancel, retain, release, or transfer a resource.
- Completion obligations: which represented executions and cleanup must finish.
- Admission: which participant authorizes and protects each admitted call.
- Context derivation: which capabilities and constraints an invocation receives.

These relationships need not form the same graph. Scope nesting does not prove
that shared-work or cancellation relationships form a tree. Cycles and repeated
links require an explicit reentrancy/termination policy, not recursive
unbounded forwarding or an assumption that every graph is acyclic.

Observable events include invocation, admission, request issuance, signal
observation, result selection, result settlement, work settlement, cleanup start,
cleanup finish, release, and actual completion. Their order is a partial order:
unrelated concurrent events have no claimed global order. A selected result may
settle before owned losers complete; an owner must still retain those completion
obligations. Resource use may not occur after its valid release boundary.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-RELATIONS-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-RELATIONS-001 - Relationships do not grant each other's authority

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

A composition MUST NOT infer cancellation authority, release ownership,
admission, or completion from observing a result, containing a context reference,
sharing a signal, or participating in a result combinator. An explicit contract
must establish each authority or obligation separately.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-COMPLETION-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-COMPLETION-001 - Completion is boundary-relative and retained

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

A scope or provider claiming ownership MUST retain represented work and required
cleanup until actual completion at its declared boundary. Result settlement,
cancellation requests, timeout, and waiter abandonment MUST NOT discharge that
obligation. Early-result APIs MUST provide a documented way for the owner to
retain and observe actual completion without re-running the execution. A single
completion-safe return value is also valid; two handles are not universally
required. Non-cooperative work may prevent completion indefinitely.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-REPRESENTATION-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-REPRESENTATION-001 - Representation has honest limits

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

An adapter MUST state which returned work, thenables, spawned executions, and
cleanup it represents. It MUST NOT claim to join detached work, infer execution
completion from an arbitrary promise executor's return, or supervise opaque
effects merely by wrapping a result. Work extending beyond a scope requires
explicit ownership transfer or a longer-lived owner before that scope completes.
Static types and garbage collection do not establish these lifetime guarantees.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-CANCELLATION-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-CANCELLATION-001 - Requests preserve direction and reason

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

A selected direct cancellation link MUST propagate pre-existing and subsequent
upstream abortion with exact reason identity. Downstream cancellation MUST NOT
abort upstream or sibling sources without separately granted authority and
selected policy. Repeated requests follow a documented first-request or other
explicit arbitration rule; they MUST NOT silently overwrite established reasons.
No supplied rejection value may be rewritten merely because it resembles a
default cancellation error. Native no-reason abort behavior must be documented.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-LINKS-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-LINKS-001 - Linking lifetime follows represented completion

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

The owner of a cancellation link MUST remove its listeners on actual completion
and unwind partially installed listeners on setup failure. Abandoning a waiter
MUST NOT remove links still required by represented active work. Explicit
unlinking MUST be idempotent. Link disposal does not itself prove work
completion, and permission to unlink is not permission to release live work.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-PROPAGATION-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-PROPAGATION-001 - Propagation topology and shielding are explicit

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

An API combining cancellation inputs MUST declare its selection rule, handling
of already-aborted inputs, tie ordering, output reason, duplicate links, and
cleanup ownership. Any-source forwarding, all-source/quorum policies, fan-out,
and shielding are different policies, not synonyms. Shielding MUST explicitly
omit or defer a named propagation path; it MUST NOT imply that an already-aborted
signal became un-aborted or that every mandatory cleanup can be cancelled.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-WAITING-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-WAITING-001 - Wait abandonment is separate from stopping work

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

A cancellable wait MUST declare whether it only rejects that waiter or also
requests cancellation under explicit authority. Borrowed work MUST NOT be
cancelled, released, or reported completed solely because one waiter leaves.
Abandoned paths MUST continue to handle eventual represented rejections and
retain mandatory cleanup; they MUST NOT silently convert execution failure into
success. The owner-facing completion channel and failure policy must be explicit.

### Composition policy vocabulary

The table describes independent policy dimensions, not mandatory export names.
Native result combinators remain valid for borrowed results; owning execution
combinators additionally carry explicit cancellation and completion policies.
The vocabulary does not require every provider to implement every policy.
Unsupported policies must be explicit; evidence covers the policies actually
offered, not imaginary any/all/quorum or supervision implementations.

| Composition | Result selection | Cancellation and completion decisions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sequence | Later stage depends on earlier selected outcome. | Forward to the active stage under declared authority; handle requests during stage transitions; do not start forbidden later work after cancellation. |
| All results | All fulfillments, or a selected failure under declared fail-fast/collect policy. | Declare whether failure signals owned siblings; retain all owned work and cleanup regardless of early selected failure. |
| All outcomes | One fulfillment/rejection outcome per participating result. | A failed candidate does not itself imply sibling cancellation; external cancellation is a separate policy. |
| First settlement | First observed fulfillment or rejection under declared tie ordering. | Declare whether losers continue, receive requests, or are transferred; winner selection does not complete losers. |
| First success | First observed fulfillment; aggregate failure if no candidate succeeds. | An earlier candidate failure does not imply cancelling viable candidates; declare post-success loser policy and failure ordering. |
| Cancellation fan-in | A declared rule combines several request inputs. | Declare any/all/quorum selection and reason arbitration; do not confuse request aggregation with result aggregation. |
| Cancellation fan-out | One request reaches several designated sources. | Retain independent state and authority; one recipient cannot automatically cancel siblings. |
| Shared execution | Several subscribers observe one execution. | A subscriber can abandon its wait without cancelling shared work; source cancellation requires owner policy, such as explicit last-subscriber handling. |
| Retry | A declared policy selects successive attempts and their final outcome. | Distinguish retained versus fresh resources and total versus per-attempt budget; old attempts must not escape their owner. |
| Shielded region | Result follows the region's declared work. | State which incoming requests are omitted/deferred, how requests resume, and which owner retains completion. |

<a id="REQ-EXEC-COMBINATORS-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-COMBINATORS-001 - Combinator policy is complete before migration

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

An owning combinator MUST declare startup/admission policy, result selection,
request forwarding, sibling/loser policy, actual completion, cleanup failure,
empty-input behavior, synchronous setup failure, and tie/arbitration behavior.
Iteration or startup failure after partial acquisition MUST retain and unwind
already owned work. A migration MUST map useful existing graph semantics to
explicit replacements before removing forwarding or chaining mechanisms. A
native promise combinator alone is not an owning replacement.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-SHARED-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-SHARED-001 - Shared subscriptions do not mint source authority

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

A shared-execution provider MUST separate subscriber lifetime from source
lifetime. If it offers last-subscriber cancellation, its contract MUST define
subscription admission, unsubscribe/subscribe races, late joins during shutdown,
idempotent departure, and who observes source completion and failure. A count of
current waiters alone MUST NOT justify releasing resources while work is active.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-FAILURES-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-FAILURES-001 - Failure channels retain primary and secondary facts

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

Compositions MUST preserve arbitrary rejection values, including undefined,
null, and explicit cancellation-shaped errors. They MUST define deterministic
ordering and identity preservation for aggregate failures and simultaneous
primary/cleanup failures. A result already delivered to a waiter need not be
replaced by a later loser failure; however, that failure MUST remain observable
through the documented owner-facing completion or failure channel. Identical
values MUST NOT be used to deduplicate distinct failures without an explicit rule.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-TIMING-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-TIMING-001 - Constraints, scheduling, and budgets are distinct

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

A fixed deadline constraint MUST identify its clock and finite absolute bound.
Intersection within one compatible clock domain MUST choose the minimum bound;
incompatible domains require rejection or an explicit conversion contract.
Relative budgets MUST state when they become absolute. Retry placement MUST
distinguish total and per-attempt budgets, and neither may widen an inherited
bound. Expired constraints MUST NOT restart with fresh time. Scheduling ownership,
reset/refresh semantics, borrowed timers, and handler completion require separate
contracts; timer cancellation is not proof that a running handler finished.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-ADMISSION-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-ADMISSION-001 - Admission and release remain participant-owned

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

An admitted represented execution MUST retain provider-required protection
through work and mandatory cleanup. Context copies, signal links, and waiter
settlement MUST NOT forge admission or discharge completion leases. Shutdown
policy MUST state admission closure, request ordering, in-flight completion, and
release prerequisites; when work requires a shutdown request to finish, the
provider MUST NOT wait for completion before issuing that required request.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-BOUNDARIES-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-BOUNDARIES-001 - Providers expose mechanisms without a universal engine

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

Shared context contracts MUST NOT require a universal task carrier, supervisor,
effect interpreter, global registry, or common base class. Specialized providers
MUST retain their scheduling, locking, lifecycle, transaction, and release
invariants. Applications select supported composition policies through reusable
provider mechanisms rather than reimplementing private machinery. Structural
compatibility and runtime package dependency direction are separate from
specification replication; neither requires cross-repository specification access.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-LAWS-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-LAWS-001 - Laws state their domain and observations

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

Every equivalence or algebraic law claim MUST state its inputs, authority,
ownership, clock, scheduling assumptions, and observed events. Compatible
requirement fields MUST NOT imply commuting executions. Inert, compatible scope
construction can support identity/association claims only under the stated
observation model; acquisition/release order remains observable. Fixed absolute
minimum is associative, commutative, and idempotent only in one compatible clock
domain. These laws MUST NOT be generalized to resettable timers, relative/idle
budgets, effectful clock reads, or handler-owning races.

Counterexamples include retry outside versus inside a transaction, total budget
outside retry versus fresh budgets inside attempts, and a race whose loser owns
cleanup versus one that merely borrows candidate results. Cancellation links may
be idempotent in final signal state while still differing in listener or request
traces. A law must name which of those observations it preserves.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-EVIDENCE-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-EVIDENCE-001 - Cases and conformance claims are bounded

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

Evidence MUST identify the implementation revision, selected policy, observable
trace, and requirement clauses it exercises. Deterministic gates and injected
clocks SHOULD establish race ordering rather than timing sleeps. Model fixtures,
real provider integration, declaration compatibility, and package-consumer
evidence MUST remain distinguishable. A case inventory, passing test count, or
replicated text MUST NOT be reported as full runtime conformance.

<a id="REQ-EXEC-REPLICATION-001"></a>

### REQ-EXEC-REPLICATION-001 - Semantic editions are self-contained and drift-aware

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

A repository adopting this semantic edition MUST retain the full shared
definitions and clauses locally, with matching shared identifiers and edition.
Its record MUST NOT import normative meaning from another specification through
a link, include, sibling path, or instruction to consult it. Provider obligations
and evidence are local additions and MUST NOT silently weaken shared clauses.
Shared semantic text for one edition MUST remain equivalent across replicas;
material revisions require a new edition and explicit local adoption decisions.
Acceptance, evidence, and releases remain independent per repository. Neither
local validation nor package installation may require sibling checkouts to read
or validate the adopted record.

### Planned execution cases

All cases below are planned obligations, not execution receipts. Each applicable
case needs a deterministic trace, outcome assertions, and cleanup observations.

| Case | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| CASE-EXEC-DIRECTION | Pre-aborted and later upstream requests preserve exact reason; downstream requests cannot abort upstream or unrelated recipients. |
| CASE-EXEC-FANIN | Multiple live/pre-aborted inputs, duplicate links, competing reasons, and each offered any/all/quorum policy follow declared arbitration. |
| CASE-EXEC-SHIELD | A named upstream path is omitted/deferred while required cleanup remains owned and any resumed propagation is explicit. |
| CASE-EXEC-WAITER | One waiter abandons; represented work continues, receives later required requests, and retains failure observation through completion. |
| CASE-EXEC-SEQUENCE | A request during stage handoff reaches the designated active stage or prevents later startup under the declared policy. |
| CASE-EXEC-ALL | Selected early failure, optional sibling requests, and all owned cleanup are distinct events. |
| CASE-EXEC-OUTCOMES | One candidate failure does not imply sibling cancellation; outcome order and external request policy are explicit. |
| CASE-EXEC-RACE | Winner settles before a gated loser finishes; loser cancellation policy and retained completion are independently asserted. |
| CASE-EXEC-SUCCESS | Early failure leaves viable candidates; success selects once; all-failed ordering and owned-loser completion remain explicit. |
| CASE-EXEC-PARTIAL | Startup/iteration/listener setup failure after partial acquisition unwinds only owned state and preserves primary/cleanup failures. |
| CASE-EXEC-SUBSCRIBERS | One subscriber leaves while another still needs shared work; final departure races with new admission under explicit owner policy. |
| CASE-EXEC-TIME | Same-clock minimum laws, mismatched domains, expired constraints, total/per-attempt budgets, and borrowed scheduling are distinguished. |
| CASE-EXEC-ADMISSION | Abandoned waits and projected contexts cannot release admission protection; shutdown requests precede waits when required for progress. |
| CASE-EXEC-FAILURES | Arbitrary reasons, concurrent failures, late loser failure, and asynchronous cleanup failure retain identity and declared ordering. |
| CASE-EXEC-NONCOOPERATIVE | A requested but non-cooperative execution remains incomplete; any bounded test uses explicit gates, not a false stop guarantee. |

<!-- shared-execution-semantics: execution-semantics-1 end -->

### Repository adoption profile

This repository owns clocks exposed by its API, scheduling, timer state,
reset/refresh behavior, deadline enforcement, and represented timer-handler
completion. Cancellation-link mechanisms may be reused from a dedicated
provider; that reuse does not transfer scheduling authority or permit premature
release. All definitions and rules needed to interpret this boundary are local.

<a id="REQ-TIMER-EXECUTION-001"></a>

### REQ-TIMER-EXECUTION-001 - Scheduling settlement is not handler completion

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

The timer API MUST distinguish pending scheduling, a running handler, selected
waiter settlement, and actual handler completion. Cancelling pending scheduling
must prevent later handler startup under the declared race policy. Requesting
cancellation after handler startup MUST NOT claim that the handler stopped or
allow an owning scope to release while represented handler work remains active.
If a waiting result can reject early, the owner MUST retain independently
observable actual completion. State names and promise implementation choices
must describe these facts honestly.

<a id="REQ-TIMER-CONSTRAINTS-001"></a>

### REQ-TIMER-CONSTRAINTS-001 - Pure constraints preserve clock and inherited bound

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

Fixed constraints MUST capture finite absolute bounds and clock identity without
starting scheduling. Same-domain intersection MUST use the minimum and reject
incompatible domains absent explicit conversion. Relative scopes MUST state the
execution-time conversion point, validate their duration, and retain an inherited
absolute bound across nested attempts. Already expired bounds must not restart.
Clock units, permitted clock movement, host-scheduler relationship, and early or
long-range wakeup handling must be stated. Pure constraint composition must not
acquire ownership of a referenced timer or cancellation source.

<a id="REQ-TIMER-OWNERSHIP-001"></a>

### REQ-TIMER-OWNERSHIP-001 - Owned scheduling and borrowed timers remain distinct

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

An enforcing or owning timer scope MUST state which scheduling, signal links,
and handler completion it owns and unwind them after represented completion.
It MUST NOT cancel, reset, refresh, or release a borrowed timer merely because a
body or waiter finishes. A contract accepting both a borrowed timer and signal
MUST state whether they are already linked or whether the provider installs a
new explicitly owned link; it MUST NOT infer that relationship from co-location
in a context. Setup/body/handler/cleanup failures require separate observations.

<a id="REQ-TIMER-COMPOSITION-001"></a>

### REQ-TIMER-COMPOSITION-001 - Timing compositions preserve execution policy

Level: MUST. Requirement status: target. Evidence status: unevidenced.

Examples and migration evidence MUST distinguish a total budget around retry,
fresh per-attempt budgets within retry, competing deadlines, and a timed wait
around shared or borrowed work. Expiration may select a waiter failure and/or
request cancellation only under declared policy and authority; it MUST NOT
complete owned losers, release admission, or widen an outer bound. Resettable,
refreshable, idle, and handler-owning timers MUST NOT claim the pure fixed-minimum
laws without a separate restricted observation model and evidence.

### Local planned cases

These cases extend the shared inventory; none is a passing execution receipt.

| Case | Local obligation |
| --- | --- |
| CASE-TIMER-PENDING-RUNNING | Gate expiry/start/cancellation races and distinguish pending cancellation from running-handler completion. |
| CASE-TIMER-BOUND-MINIMUM | Test fixed same-clock minimum laws, immutable capture, mismatch rejection, and no scheduling during pure construction. |
| CASE-TIMER-BUDGET-ORDER | Observe total versus per-attempt budgets, inherited bounds, and no restart after expiry. |
| CASE-TIMER-BORROWED | Exercise no input, borrowed signal, borrowed timer, and both supplied; assert precisely which links and scheduling may be changed. |
| CASE-TIMER-LOSER-CLEANUP | A race selects a result while an owned handler remains gated; release waits for required completion and late failure stays observable. |
| CASE-TIMER-CLOCK-WAKEUP | Inject clock readings and host wakeups to establish units, early wakeup rechecks, and supported long-range behavior. |

## Consequences

### Positive

Graph composition can be discussed without conflating ancestry, cancellation,
ownership, and completion. Replicas remain independently understandable.

### Negative

Replicated text needs explicit edition review. Provider migrations require more
than renaming methods or replacing cancellable values with native promises.

### Neutral

Parent/child remains permitted as qualified shorthand. The vocabulary does not
force a scheduler, an implementation language representation, or a task tree.

## Decision Outcome

Propose the complete shared edition and the repository adoption profile above.
No implementation or full requirement satisfaction is asserted. Provider APIs
remain subject to graph-semantic inventory and evidence review.

## Related Decisions

This record is self-contained and does not incorporate another specification by
reference. It does not change any historical record's lifecycle status.

## Links

No external or cross-specification dependencies are required. Requirement and
case identifiers in this record are interpreted using the definitions above.

The attached [conformance mapping](conformance.yml) binds local cases without
accepting this decision or claiming full requirement satisfaction.

## More Information

Shared editions coordinate vocabulary and behavior, not package version pins.
A package can adopt the same edition while implementing different explicitly
selected policies. Such differences require documentation and evidence; textual
edition equality alone is not a compatibility proof.

## Audit

### 2026-11-03

**Status:** Pending

**Findings:**

| Finding | Files | Lines | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Self-contained execution semantics proposed | This record | Shared semantic section | Runtime cases are planned, not evidenced |
| Provider boundaries retained | This record | Repository adoption profile | No universal engine or automatic API migration adopted |

**Summary:** Defines an explicit semantic review boundary before finalizing
cancellation and timing provider rewrites. Replica validation and runtime
conformance are separate work.

**Action Required:** Validate the record and replicas, review local adoption,
inventory actual graph compositions, and attach revision-attributed evidence
before claiming requirement satisfaction or accepting the decision.
